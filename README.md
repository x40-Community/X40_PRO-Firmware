## Information
**The use of the community firmware is at your own risk. There is no liability whatsoever for any damage!** 

Please note that proper [printer setup and calibration ](http://www.x40-community.org/index.php/the-3d-printer/weedo-x40-commissioning) is required. Just installing the firmware is not enough!

The X40 PRO firmware has been optimized to work with Ultimaker Cura. If you use a different slicer, the printer may not work properly! [Please use Ultimaker Cura with X40 PRO Cura configuration to avoid any issues.](https://github.com/x40-Community/Cura_for_Weedo_X40_PRO)

The Cura printing profiles are matched to the [X40 PRO Part Community cooling system.](https://github.com/x40-Community/X40_PRO-Community_Coolingsystem) If you use the original Weedo X40 Part cooling system, the settings may not be correct or the printing may not work properly!

Please note that the High Temperature variant only works with the [High Temperature upgrade.](http://www.x40-community.org/index.php/firmware/x40-pro-high-temperature) Without the upgrade you will destroy the printer with highly toxic fumes!

## Source code
**If you want to publish a modified source code based on the X40 PRO data, please use a different name for the project so that nobody gets confused.**

- Search and install PlatformIO IDE from store marketplace
- Search and install ST STM32 embedded platform from PIO Home
- Copy framework-arduinoststm32-maple@99.99.99 from /buildroot/lib to PlatformIO library location (user)/.platformio/packages/
- Install the USB driver from /buildroot/driver/CH341SER.ZIP

## Upload firmware

X40 uses a customized bootloader, which requires a customized download program for firmware update.  

The Windows version of the download program WEEDOIAP.exe is located in the /buildroot/upload/ directory. The macos version is still under development.

Lanuch the WEEDOIAP.exe, open the firmware.bin file from build directory, choice the com port, then click the update.

X40 will restart to enter the firmware update mode. Wait for about 1 minute, the printer will automatically restart after the firmware update is completed.

## The difference between the X40 PRO community version firmware and the Weedo Stock firmware

The stock firmware has the function of upgrading the firmware via TF card. Use the IAP function in the control menu to read the flash.wfm file on the TF card to upgrade the firmware.

The X40 PRO community version firmware does not support the wfm format, so it does not support firmware upgrade via TF card. Please use the flashing software for an up or down grade.


## Return to the official vesrion firmware

Use WEEDOIAP.exe to flash X40_Vxxx_Community_to_Official.bin in the /Release directory from the Weedo source code.
